# RISC-V Hello World

This is a simple proof of concept, running Rust on an bare-metal FPGA RISC-V processor generated by https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v.

I could not get Rustc/LLD and the [riscv-rt crate](https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv-rt) alone to generate an executable that would run, so I resorted to compiling to a static library then linking using the makefile and link script from [this example](https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v/tree/master/bare-metal).
